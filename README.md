# Stock_Performance_Web_Scraping
Analysing Stock Performance and Visualising results

File_1: Extracting stock data using python library (yfinance).
In this lab we use the yfinance python library to extract data for some stocks using their ticker symbol. We use the 'wget' function with the help of yfinance library and we save the data in a json file.

File_2: Extracting stock data using web scraping.
In this lab we use the alternative method of webscraping to extract similar data using the requests library. We parsed the data with the 'Beautiful soup' library and we read them from html files. We finally fed them to a pandas dataframe.

Final Assignment: Extracting and Visualising data.
In this assignment we extracted stock data with the former two ways (webscraping and python library). We again parsed the html file using BeautifulSoup and built a pandas dataframe
